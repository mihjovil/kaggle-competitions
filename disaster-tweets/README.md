# Disaster Tweets competition
The idea of this project is to predict when a tweet is referring to a disaster or not. The dataset comes form a Kaggle competition and it has a train and test partition. Using NLP to convert the tweets into sequences I will check which statistical model gives the best performance and compare it to different Deep learning approaches.
